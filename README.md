## Hot Code Push

### Test Desktop App (Electron AutoUpdater)

1. Make new repository on GitHub and push this repo
2. Change `package.json` repository url on root folder with your new repo

```
...
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/yourRepositoryName.git"
},
...
```
3. Change `dev-app-update.yml` owner & repo on root folder with your new repo
```
owner: yourGitHubUsername
repo: yourRepositoryName
provider: github

```
4. Create personal access token on GitHub. You can follow [the instructions here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
5. Run `export GH_TOKEN=yourGithubPersonalAccessToken` via bash on your root folder
6. Run `export CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` to disable code signing during the build process on Mac
7. Run `yarn desktop-deploy` to build and publish your app on GitHub release (see **All Script** to choose specific platform)
8. Go to your GitHub repository page, click **"releases"** tab. Click on **"Edit"**, and then **"Publish"** to finalize the release
9. Increment the **"version"** number in `package.json` and make any visual change so you can notice the update easily
```
...
"version": "0.0.2",
...
```
10. Run `yarn desktop-deploy` again and finalize your release
11. Download, install and run the previous version of your app from GitHub release page. Or you can decreate **"version"** number in `package.json` and undo any change on your repo. Then `run desktop`.
12. After the new version of your app is downloaded, click **"Restart"** and wait until it open again with the latest version.

### Test Mobile App (AppCenter.ms Code-Push)

1. Run `yarn android` or `yarn ios`
2. Make any visual change so you can notice the update easily
